-- a brief description --
Subflow is Polygon's first third-party subscription model for web2 integration. Subflow can be
used by web2 companies that have subscription services and want to integrate web3. Subflow is
used to create a subscription contract for the web2 company. The web2 company can create plans,
and the subscription contract created manages access based on the subscription plans of the users.


--the use of product--
##WEB2 Companies/ DEVELOPERS
A web2 company representative can visit the platform and 'create a service.' Subflow generates
 a subscription contract for the web2 company that includes a checkValidity function. The web2 company refers
 to this function to manage subscribers' access to its platform. The web2 team can also create
 a UI on their end by using the subscription contract address and the ABI (provided by subflow).
Users' interactions with the web2 plaform are reflected for the service on Subflow, and subscriptions can be
managed on any platform (Subflow or the web2 company).

# USERS
Users connect to the platform and are immediately presented with a list of available services.
Services can be found by name or address. The user is presented with the subscription plans of the web2 service
and they can be subscribed to, granting access to the the web2 platform. Users can switch between the navigaion tab
to manage all services subscribed to, and can also create a service, with its subscription plans.
